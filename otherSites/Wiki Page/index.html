		<h1>Gérard Historical Fiction</h1>
		<div>
			<h2>by Jonas Knochelmann</h2>
			<p>
			This project is an attempt to create a realistic, but entirely fictional historical event and the intertwining web of connections surrounding it. To be clear, none of the people, things, or events described in this story really existed, but the goal was to seamlessly weave them into real history in a believable fashion. 
			</p>
			<p>
			With that in mind, the following pages:
			</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Guillaume-Léon Gérard</li>
			<li>Gérard Engine</li>
			<li>Jean Frère</li>
			<li>Deciphering of the Gérard Engine</li>
			<li>Pascal Zagré</li>
			<li>Aurélie Noe</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			Were written by me. However, they contain many links to other people, things and events that really did exist. So please, explore the narrative naturally and follow any links that sound interesting or you want to know more about, as they are meant to be part of the narrative as well.
