                    I'm Jonas, a recent computer science graduate from the University of Utah. I'm currently 
					in the process of preparing for this upcoming round of computer science PhD applications. 
					I am eagerly searching for new work and research opportunities! 
                    <br><br>
                    I have two years of experience as an undergraduate researcher with Professor
                    Rogelio E. Cardona-Rivera and his Quantitative Experience Design Lab, and 
                    several ongoing projects. My research has been varied, but I am broadly interested
                    in programming languages, computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and games 
                    research.

                <h2>Bronco Text Generator</h2>
                <p>
                    Bronco is a domain-specific programming language for procedural text generation. 
                    It allows users to author grammar-based text generators using a feature-rich, 
                    Turing-complete language. It is written as an extensible C# library and a standalone 
                    IDE, both open source on <a href="https://github.com/qed-lab/Bronco-Text-Generator">GitHub</a>. 
                    <br><br>
                    The language was made over a summer, funded through 
                    <a href="https://our.utah.edu/research-scholarship-opportunities/urop/">UROP</a> 
                    and <a href="https://our.utah.edu/research-scholarship-opportunities/spur/">SPUR</a>, 
                    under Professor Rogelio E. Cardona-Rivera and his Quantitative Experience Design 
                    Laboratory. It was the subject of a publication: <a href="files/knochelmann2022bronco.pdf">
                    Bronco: A Universal Authoring Language for Controllable Text Generation</a> at ICIDs 2022.

                <p>
                    GTPCG is an ongoing research project exploring the potential connection between 
                    group theory and procedural content generation. More specifically, we propose 
                    that PCG artifacts can be described with groups and that such descriptions can 
                    be used for new methods of generation and analysis.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus far, I and Professor Rogelio E. Cardona-Rivera have been researching 
                    generation, my exhaustive execution of group actions. This work has resulted in 
                    a <a href="files/GTPCG Poster.pdf">poster presentation</a>, and a <a href="files/GTPCG.pdf">research paper submission</a>. We are currently 
                    in the process of another paper submission, and releasing an extension for Blender, 
                    allowing for group theoretic generation of 3D geometry.

                <p>
                    BIT4D (Back In The 4th Dimension), is a little 4-dimensional rendering engine 
                    built in Godot. Using the slicing method, it renders 4D geometry by calculating 
                    its 3-dimensional intersection with the view plane. Still in progress, it currently 
                    supports lighting and texturing, and will eventually include collision and simple 
                    physics. The current version is <a href="https://github.com/JonasPKnoch/BIT4D">available on GitHub</a>.  
                    <br><br>
                    The rendering is done efficiently on the GPU. The 4D models are loaded from a 
                    custom file format that can be converted from 4D OFF.

                <h2>4D Axonometric Projection</h2>
                <p>
                    4D axonometric projection is a method of mapping 4 dimensions down to 2 
                    orthographically; without perspective. I’ve made a collection of tools for 
                    rendering 4D geometry with this method. It uses a custom file format and can 
                    render in multiple formats. The project is made in Processing and is 
                    <a href="https://github.com/JonasPKnoch/4DAxonometric">available on GitHub</a>. 
                    A more detailed writeup of the method can also be found on the repository.

                    Colder On Mars is a silly little web applet I made to teach myself web programming. 
                    Using numerous APIs strung together, it compares the weather at the user’s current
